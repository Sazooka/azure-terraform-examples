# Documentation for Azure Terraform Examples

This site provides key design concepts for building Azure resources with Terraform,
along with sample configurations for Terraform on Azure.
The actual source code is hosted on GitHub, and this site summarizes additional context and explanations.

# Planned Additions
I plan to add documentation about Storage Accounts and compute resources in the future.
Feedback is welcome. I’m learning English, so comments would be appreciated.
I usually use Japanese.
